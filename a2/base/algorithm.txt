---------------------------Main Function-------------------------------
-Goals:

To initialize integer array, print out the before and after in a printf statement and to pass the printValues,
sort, and swap functions values


-Output

Prints to the screen each sorting iteration under the before line and prints out the
sorted array under the after line

-Steps:

//Print out before in a printf statement

//Print out the values of the array using the printValues function

//Sort and print the iterations of sorting with the sort function

//Print out the sorted array using the printValues; function again
----------------------Print Values Function-------------------------------
-Goal:

To print out the values in the array as they appear in the array

-Output:

The printed and formmated version of the array elements passed to
the function

-Steps:

//Initialize a counter variable as i

//Print out the beginning bracket with a printf statement

//Write a for loop that counts to the the amount of elements
	in the array

//Inside the for loop, write a printf statement that prints out 
	the ith element to the monitor

//After the for loop print out a closing bracket with a newline character

-------------------Sort Function--------------------------------------

-Goal:

To use nested for loops to sort the integer array into ascending order

-Output:
Each iteration of the new list using the printValues function

-Steps

//Initialize two counter variables

//Write the outer for loop to count until the size of the array minus one

//Write the inner for loop to run for the size minus one

//In the inner loop, write an if condition where if the current element is 
	larger than the next element in the array, execute the swap function 
	and pass the swap function the two pointers

//After the if statement, print out the current array iteration using the 
	print values program
	
-------------------Swap Function--------------------------------------------
-Goal:
Swap the pointers passed to the function

-Input:
Two pointer values that are passed to the function

-Steps:

//Initialize a temporary pointer variables

//Swap the two variables by setting the temporary pointer equal
	to the pointer "a", setting the pointer "a" equal to 
	pointer "b", and then setting pointer "b" equal to the
	temporary variable
