# Some notes about about some changes I've made

I've made it to where the output file is removed and a new one is made when
ever the make clean command is run. I've also added a bit of functionality to where
the program can very easily deal with edge cases such as zeros, negative numbers, more
or less numbers, and empty spaces and lines.
